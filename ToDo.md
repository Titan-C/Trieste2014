After a review with the students and how the hands on session worked out

Still need to do:
-Enforcing in the des_engine the implementation of certain methods
-the extension of constructors
-Documentation of the des_engine interface so people can use it directly
-Include graphics of it so people undestrand its inner working
-Improve on naming of classes and inheritance reasons
-Possible include the simulator.inset(self) instruction hint after implementing the queue or define
a more structured logic to introduce such function.
