# Refresher

## The Big Idea

* _Humanize_ how we deal with our code
* _Delegate_ certain tasks to whom can do them best and reliably


# Queuing Simulation

##Main tasks

* Work on a discrete event simulation to analyze the behavior of a bank queue. 
* Get used to OOP

# The problem:


## Queues in the bank

![Bank queue](images/bank-queue.jpg)

## What do you see?

## How does it behave?


# The modeling method

## Discrete Event Simulation

Abstractly, a discrete event simulation consists of a bunch of events and a
central simulator object that executes these events in order. 


* **Arrival Process** 

* **Service Process**

* **Number of Servers**
